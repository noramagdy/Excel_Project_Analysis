# Excel_Project_Analysis
You will be following the scenario of a recently hired Junior
Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked
with importing some data from another department which relates
to inventory information about their fleet of vehicles. The data
is in comma-separated value (CSV) format and the data also
needs cleaning up before you can start to run any kind of
analysis on it.
You also need to sort and analyze fleet inventory data that was
previously imported and cleaned. You plan to use pivot tables
to analyze the data.

-Required
1. Cleaning
Check for
• Empty rows.
• Duplicate records.
• Spelling errors.
• Whitespaces.
• Importing errors.

2. Analysis
• Calculate sum, average, min, max, and count for column
“C”.
• Create a column “Level” used to check whether number of
vehicles in column “C” is Big, Moderate, or Small. (>100,
>50, >0).
• Sort dataset in ascending order according to Department,
Equipment Class, and Equipment Count sequentially.

3. Pivot Table
• Create a Pivot table to display the sum of Equipment Count
by Department.
• Sort the sum of equipment count by department resulted
from the previous task, in descending order.

• Create a Pivot table to make the different vehicle types
appear under each department with their respective counts.
• Make a slicer to easily filter the existed Departments, and
another one for Equipment Count.
